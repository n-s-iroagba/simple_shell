##ALX-HOLBERTON SCHOOL SIMPLE SHELL PROJECT

This project was given by Holberton School to help students learn the fundamental working principles of a simple shell 
using syscalls and C standard library functions.

#HOW TO RUN
The program can be compiled using the gcc compiler and some flags in the following manner:
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh

Note that you should have a valid C compiler installed, for this to work. In this example we have used gcc but you can replace it with clang or any other compiler available on your machine.
Then you can run in interactive mode like ./hsh
The code above is for a unix type machine, for windows, the compilation will produce a hsh.exe which you can click on
Or in non interactive mode like echo "/bin/ls" | ./hsh
